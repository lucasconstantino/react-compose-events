# React Compose Events [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lucasconstantino/react-compose-events.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lucasconstantino/react-compose-events)

> A Higher-Order Component factory to attach outside event listeners

## Why?

It is not that common nowadays, but sometimes, when developing for the web, we still need to rely on events that happen on objects out of React application scope; window events, for instance. There are a couple of solutions out there - the most prominent probably being [react-event-listener](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-event-listener) - but none solved this problem in a way such that it would be easy to use with composition libraries such as [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose). *react-compose-events* does that.

## Install

`yarn add react-compose-events`

> Or, good ol' `npm install --save react-compose-events`

## Usage

### Simple as can

```js
import { withEvents } from 'react-compose-events'

const MyScrollListeningComponent = () => (
  <p>
    Look at your console!
  </p>
)

export default withEvents(window, {
  scroll: () => console.log('scrolling!')
})(MyScrollListeningComponent)
```

### With recompose friends

Usually you'll need events to fire in a global object, but have them affect the props used on the components. Here goes some example using recompose tools.

```js
import { compose, withState, withHandlers } from 'recompose'
import { withEvents } from 'react-compose-events'

const MyScrollListeningComponent = ({ scrollTop }) => (
  <p>
    Look! Scroll is at { scrollTop }
  </p>
)

export default compose(
  withState('scrollTop', 'setScrollTop', 0),
  withHandlers({
    scroll: ({ setScrollTop }) => e => setScrollTop(window.scrollY)
  }),
  withEvents(window, ({ scroll }) => ({ scroll })),
)(MyScrollListeningComponent)
```

Notice here that the second argument of `withEvents` can be either an object mapping event names to handlers, or a function, which will be called with the piping props and should return the map of events. This way you can have event handlers based on passed props - such as handlers created via `withHandlers`, as the example shows.

### With `EventEmitter.on` and recompose friends

Sometimes you would like to listen to an EventEmitter, you can currently can try use this example as a reference:

```js
import { compose, withState, withHandlers } from 'recompose'
import { withEvents } from 'react-compose-events'

const MessageEventEmitterListeningComponent = ({ messageText }) => (
  <p>
    Last Message: { messageText }
  </p>
)

export default compose(
  withState('messageText', 'setMessageText', 'No messages yet.'),
  withHandlers({
    message: ({ setMessageText }) => (e, text) => setMessageText(text),
  }),
  withEvents(
    {
      addEventListener: (e, f) => YourEventEmitter.on(e, f),
    },
    ({ message }) => ({ message }),
  ),
)(MessageEventEmitterListeningComponent);
```

## Warnings

### Server-side rendering

On SSR you might run into trouble when trying to access global objects such as `window`, which will probably not be availble. For these cases, the first argument of `withEvents` can also be passed a function, which will be called only when attaching the event listeners, during `componentDidMount`.

### Function implementations as target

If the provided target both is an implementation of the `EventTarget` interface and has a `typeof` of `function`, it will be executed when resolving the target, which might not be intended. To avoid that, you might want to provided the target as a simple function returning the real target.
